# Wheel-Analyzer Development Roadmap

Wheel Analyzer is a Django-based web application for tracking and analyzing stock options trading, specifically focused on the "wheel strategy" (selling puts, taking assignment, selling calls). The application helps track options campaigns, individual transactions, and scan for new trading opportunities.

## Overview

Wheel Analyzer looks through a curated list of stocks, finds their options for a given time period and analyzes them, looking for options that provide a 30% or greater annualized return with a delta of less than .20 or -.20

## Development Workflow

1. **Task Planning**

- Study the existing codebase and understand the current state
- Update `ROADMAP.md` to include the new task
- Priority tasks should be inserted after the last completed task

2. **Task Creation**

- Study the existing codebase and understand the current state
- Create a new task file in the `/tasks` directory
- Name format: `XXX-description.md` (e.g., `001-db.md`)
- Include high-level specifications, relevant files, acceptance criteria, and implementation steps
- Refer to last completed task in the `/tasks` directory for examples. For example, if the current task is `012`, refer to `011` and `010` for examples.
- Note that these examples are completed tasks, so the content reflects the final state of completed tasks (checked boxes and summary of changes). For the new task, the document should contain empty boxes and no summary of changes. Refer to `000-sample.md` as the sample for initial state.

3. **Task Implementation**

- Follow the specifications in the task file
- Implement features and functionality
- Update step progress within the task file after each step
- Stop after completing each step and wait for further instructions

4. **Roadmap Updates**

- Mark completed tasks with ✅ in the roadmap
- Add reference to the task file (e.g., `See: /tasks/001-db.md`)

## Task Files

Detailed implementation tasks are tracked in the `/tasks` directory:


## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Curated Stock List

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Related Tasks**:

- ✅ `001-curated-stock-model.md` - Created CuratedStock Django model with admin interface
- ✅ `002-data-migration.md` - Migrated 26 stocks from JSON to database
- ✅ `003-update-scanner.md` - Updated scanner commands to use database model

**Summary**:
Successfully migrated from JSON-based stock management to a database-driven CuratedStock model. The scanner commands (`cron_sma` and `cron_scanner`) now query active stocks from the database, enabling dynamic stock management through the Django admin interface. All 26 stocks were successfully imported and verified. See task files for detailed implementation notes.

### Phase 2: Fair value calculation automation

**Status**: Not Started

**Related Tasks**: To be defined
